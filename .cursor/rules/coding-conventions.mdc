The followig is a list of coding conventions you must follow whenever writing new code

- Try to include consicse and descriptive method comments when applicable 
- Write inline comments when there are large blocks of code. Do not over-explain though, keep your comments concise and targeted. For instance, if a variable name describes its purpose you do not need to add an inline comment to double-explain its' purpose
- When writing TypeScript use apostrophes for Strings rather than double quotes
- Do not end lines with semicolons
- Do not prefix variable names with $
- Avoid using mocks in tests when possible. Try and test the actual production code
- Use modern syntax when possible, for example ?? instead of ||
- Do not go beyond 80 characters on a single line of code
- Do not have methods longer than the length of the page (40 lines)
- When modifying existing code be surgical and precise. Try to make as few changes as possible while still fully implementing the desired functionality
- Make sure file names and classes match
- Avoid using double negatives
